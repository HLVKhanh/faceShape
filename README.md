Goal: classify 6 types of face shape and extract facial features from images (landmarks and distances)

Usage:
  
    1. mediapipe_drawDistancesWithCam: draw facial distances with realtime web cam
    
    2. landmark.ipynb: extract landmarks and distances from images
    
    3. crop_retain_scale_image_by_Face_BBox: crop facial area only while retain images ratio
    
    4. Swin_Transformer.ipynb: classification model
